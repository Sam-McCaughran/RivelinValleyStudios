                        <span class="bold-text">Sam</span> is the founder of Rivelin Valley Studios. With a background
                        in biology and biomedical
                        science, Sam
                        first explored the complex systems of the natural world before turning his attention to the
                        digital kind. After helping to build systems for the NHS, he now builds worlds of his own -
                        blending his love of science, design, and storytelling to craft games that are as thoughtful as
                        they are fun.
                        <br><br>
                        A pragmatist at heart, Sam believes that elegant systems - in code, design, or biology - are
                        what make great games tick.
                        When he’s not deep in code or systems design, you’ll probably find him surviving in Don’t
                        Starve, optimising in Factorio, or wandering the wastes of Fallout.

                        <span class="bold-text">Thomas</span> is Rivelin Valley Studios’ Historical Consultant, bringing
                        depth, detail, and a dash of
                        adventure to our worlds. A history graduate from the University of Lincoln, Thomas has a
                        lifelong passion for the past, especially the Age of Sail and the great empires that shaped it.
                        His love of naval history and sharp eye for authenticity make him an invaluable part of Empire’s
                        Wake, our first title set amid wind, wood, and cannon fire.
                        <br><br>
                        Beyond the archives, Thomas is a natural communicator. Having worked in teaching and museum
                        education, he doesn’t just recite history / detail he brings it vividly to life, helping players
                        feel the salt air, the tension of command, and the spirit of exploration.
                        <br><br>
                        When he’s not charting historical seas or sinking hours into World of Warcraft, War Thunder, or
                        Assassin’s Creed, you’ll probably find him in a European city with a local ale in hand, planning
                        his next adventure digital or otherwise.

                        <span class="bold-text">Gerry</span> is Rivelin Valley Studios’ Financial Officer and Design
                        Lead, balancing spreadsheets and
                        sketchbooks with equal passion. With a background spanning everything from stationery design to
                        supply and finance, she’s as comfortable analysing data as she is crafting charming worlds.
                        <br><br>
                        At Rivelin Valley Studios, Gerry leads the studio’s visual direction - creating models, art, and
                        designs that are
                        simple, bold, and full of heart. Inspired by nature and the beauty of the Rivelin Valley, her
                        work brings warmth and life to every project, proving that good design can make people feel
                        something - or even just make them smile.
                        <br><br>
                        A creative spirit backed by detail, Gerry draws her inspiration from games like Stardew Valley
                        and Don’t Starve, where art and atmosphere go hand in hand. Whether she’s fine-tuning a
                        financial forecast or adding the perfect flourish to a game asset, she makes sure Rivelin Valley
                        Studios runs beautifully, inside and out
